This one of most common question I get. Feature flags are a software development technique that turns certain functionality on and off during runtime, without deploying new code. It allows you to decouple deploy and release , giving you better control and more experimentation over the full lifecycle of features. What is the lifecycle of a flag? The lifecycle of your flags is key if you don't want to have un-used things everywhere in your code. Start by creating the flag in your configuration file (with 0% to avoid affecting your users) . Evaluate the flag in your code (see variation ) . Deploy your application with the variation check. Start rolling out your flag. When 100% of your users have access to the new feature, remove the call to the variation from your code base. Deploy your application without the variation check. Remove the flag from your configuration file. What happen if my configuration file is not reachable/deleted? If while you are on production for some reason your flag file becomes unreachable, we will be able to serve the users based on the last version of the file we were able to read. We will continue to try reading the file based on the pollingInterval you have configured. If you start a new instance, if the file is not reachable to module will fail to initialize except if you have set the option StartWithRetrieverError in the config. With this option, we will serve the SDK default value (the 3rd param in your variation) until the flag becomes available again. What is the best rollout strategy? The lib gives you a lot of strategies to rollout your flags, there is no better one, it always depends on the context of your release. If your release is not critical and, you just want an easy cut-off strategy, you can pass your flag from 0% to 100% for all your users If you are scared that your infrastructure can be impacted by the new feature, a progressive rollout can help you to impact users over time and to be able to check how your system handle it. If you want to impact only a subset of your users, you can put a rule on your flag. Etc ...

The SDK defines a User struct and a UserBuilder to make this easy. Here's an example: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 // User with only a key user1 := ffuser . NewUser ( \"user1-key\" ) // User with a key plus other attributes user2 = ffuser . NewUserBuilder ( \"user2-key\" ). AddCustom ( \"firstname\" , \"John\" ). AddCustom ( \"lastname\" , \"Doe\" ). AddCustom ( \"email\" , \"john.doe@example.com\" ). Build () The most common attribute is the user's key and this is the only mandatory user attribute. The key should also uniquely identify each user. You can use a primary key, an e-mail address, or a hash, as long as the same user always has the same key. We recommend using a hash if possible. All the other attributes are optional. Info Custom attributes are one of the most powerful features. They let you have rules on these attributes and target users according to any data that you want. Anonymous users You can also distinguish logged-in users from anonymous users in the SDK, as follows: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 // User with only a key user1 := ffuser . NewAnonymousUser ( \"user1-key\" ) // User with a key plus other attributes user2 = ffuser . NewUserBuilder ( \"user2-key\" ). Anonymous ( true ). AddCustom ( \"firstname\" , \"John\" ). AddCustom ( \"lastname\" , \"Doe\" ). AddCustom ( \"email\" , \"john.doe@example.com\" ). Build () You will still need to generate a unique key for anonymous users. Session IDs or UUIDs work best for this. Anonymous users work just like regular users, this information just helps you to add a rule to target a specific population. Variation The Variation methods determine whether a flag is enabled or not for a specific user. There is a Variation method for each type: BoolVariation , IntVariation , Float64Variation , StringVariation , JSONArrayVariation , JSONVariation 1 2 3 4 result , _ := ffclient . BoolVariation ( \"your.feature.key\" , user , false ) // result is now true or false depending on the setting of // this boolean feature flag Variation methods take the feature flag key , a user , and a default value . The default value is return when an error is encountered ( ffclient not initialized, variation with wrong type, flag does not exist ...). In the example, if the flag your.feature.key does not exists, result will be false . Not that you will always have a usable value in the result. Get all flags for a specific user If you want to send the information about a specific user to a front-end, you will want a snapshot of all the flags for this user at a specific time. The method ffclient.AllFlagsState returns a snapshot of flag values and metadata. The function is evaluating all available flags for the user and return a flagstate.AllFlagsState object containing the information you need. 1 2 3 4 5 6 user := ffuser . NewUser ( \"example\" ) // AllFlagsState will give you the value for all the flags available. allFlagsState := ffclient .
